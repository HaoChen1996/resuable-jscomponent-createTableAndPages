## Background

Many administrator applications will need to create tables and divide by pages(could be 10 rows per page or 20 rows per page),
Usually we use AJAX to get JSON format data from server, but problem is how to put data in the right cell and how to 
demonstrate data in the right format(for example: Date),what if you have a long text that cannot fit in one cell?

here is my js can solve this problem.

##Install

Actually it's pretty simple you just have to drag this file into your project current location,and import it.
```javascript
<script type="text/javascript" src="../js/table&page.js"></script>
```
